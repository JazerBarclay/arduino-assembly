/* 
 * PORT CONTROL
 * 
 * Like the led control example, we can control pin mode and
 * set LEDs high or low by controlling a bit in registers.
 * 
 * In this example we control a collection of pins by affecting
 * all bits in a given PORT.
 * 
 * To do this in C we would have to loop over each pin however
 * since we can control the whole port at once, we can set a whole
 * bunch of pins and change them all at once.
 *  
 * All code will be in the associated ".S" file in the same folder
 * Happy Coding!

/* 
 * BLINK
 * 
 * In this example we flash a single LED (pin 13 on the mega) on and off
 * with a 1 second delay between each change.
 * 
 * To do this we use a few new opcodes to call functions, create loops, 
 * temporarily store values on the stack and decrement values in registers.
 *  
 * All code will be in the associated ".S" file in the same folder
 * Happy Coding!

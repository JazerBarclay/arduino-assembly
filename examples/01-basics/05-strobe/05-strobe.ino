/* 
 * STROBE
 * 
 * In this example we make a collections of LEDs light in a sequence
 * matching a register we shift a bit in.
 * 
 * We use a bit shift operation and output the state of the register
 * to 8 LEDs on PORTA comprised of digital pins 22-29 at the bottom 
 * of the arduino mega board.
 *  
 * All code will be in the associated ".S" file in the same folder
 * Happy Coding!

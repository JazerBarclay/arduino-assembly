/* 
 * BOILERPLATE
 * 
 * This is a minimal example of getting started with
 * arduino assembly
 * 
 * We have 2 different files for writing assembly.
 * 
 * We have this .ino file where our C program would exists. We keep
 * this file so its easier to open our arduino project in the
 * arduino IDE.
 * 
 * The second file has the same name as the .ino file however has 
 * the .S extension. This is where our assembly code will reside.
 * 
 * Take a look at the other file and check out how the code is
 * setup and laid out.
 * 
 * Happy Coding!

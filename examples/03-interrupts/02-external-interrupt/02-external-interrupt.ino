/* 
 * EXTERNAL INTERRUPT
 * 
 * In this example we turn the on-board LED on or off when we receive
 * a rising edge signal on pin 2.
 * 
 * Rather than polling the pin every loop we can have the chip jump out
 * of the loop when a specified signal is received on a dedicated pin
 * and return to our main code once its completed.
 * 
 * All code will be in the associated ".S" file in the same folder
 * Happy Coding!
